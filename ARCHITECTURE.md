CAS operates orthogonally to model internals, enabling governance without constraining innovation.

## Design Principles (Hashmal Code)

All CAS primitives are grounded in the following principles:

1. Omnibenevolence  
2. Respect  
3. Integrity  
4. Non-Harm  
5. Constructive Dialogue  
6. Transparency  
7. Unity in Diversity  

These principles inform boundary definitions, escalation logic, and governance intent.

## Integration Characteristics

- Model-agnostic and architecture-independent  
- Compatible with RLHF, Constitutional AI, and other alignment techniques  
- Designed for single-agent and multi-agent systems  
- Scales across organizational, jurisdictional, and national boundaries  

---

## Summary

CAS V1 provides governance infrastructure for AI systems operating at scale.  
Its primitives ensure accountability, enforce boundaries, maintain system visibility, and preserve human authority—without relying on assumptions about model intelligence or intent.
