# CAS Use Cases
## Practical Applications of the Comprehensive Alignment System

---

## Overview

This document outlines representative use cases demonstrating how CAS primitives apply to real-world AI deployments. These examples are intentionally high-level and non-proprietary.

---

## 1. Multi-Agent AI Platforms

**Context:**  
Large AI platforms deploying multiple agents across tasks and domains.

**Challenge:**  
- Responsibility diffusion  
- Conflicting agent outputs  
- Lack of auditable decision chains  

**CAS Application:**  
- LAE preserves attribution across agents  
- DSM monitors collective system state  
- GEP enforces escalation when ambiguity arises  

**Outcome:**  
Clear accountability, reduced systemic risk, and auditable coordination.

## 2. Autonomous Robotics (GeoSovereign Contexts)

**Context:**  
Physical autonomous systems operating in culturally or environmentally sensitive areas.

**Challenge:**  
- Preventing unsafe autonomy  
- Respecting local governance and land protections  

**CAS Application:**  
- BEL enforces operational and ethical constraints  
- DSM monitors compliance  
- GEP escalates edge cases to human operators  

**Outcome:**  
Safe autonomy aligned with environmental and cultural governance.

## 3. Constitutional AI Augmentation

**Context:**  
AI models aligned through RLHF or constitutional techniques.

**Challenge:**  
- Coordination across multiple aligned systems  
- Escalation consistency  

**CAS Application:**  
- CAS wraps existing alignment layers  
- LAE enables transparent audit trails  
- GEP standardizes escalation pathways  

**Outcome:**  
System-level alignment without modifying underlying models.

## 4. High-Stakes Decision Support

**Context:**  
AI-assisted decision-making in healthcare, finance, defense, and infrastructure.

**Challenge:**  
- Regulatory accountability  
- Human-in-the-loop enforcement  

**CAS Application:**  
- BEL restricts unauthorized actions  
- LAE and DSM ensure traceability  
- GEP mandates human decision authority  

**Outcome:**  
AI augments decision-making without replacing human judgment.

## 5. Democratic and Institutional Governance (Future Domain)

**Context:**  
AI advisory systems supporting public institutions.

**Challenge:**  
- Democratic legitimacy  
- Transparency and accountability  

**CAS Application:**  
- Explicit escalation and attribution  
- Governance visibility  
- Boundary enforcement aligned with law and policy  

**Outcome:**  
AI remains advisory, accountable, and democratically governed.

---

## Summary

CAS enables scalable, auditable, human-centered AI deployment across domains by addressing governance failures that emerge beyond model-level alignment.
